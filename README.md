# Escape Links

Recognized formats:
* [exit-link] or [exit-link /]
* [exit-link]Link Text[/exit-link]
* [exit-link type=text]
* [exit-link type=button]

If using both enclosing and self-closing instances of this shortcode on the same page, make sure to add a trailing forward slash (/) to the self-closing instances of the shortcode. 

The WordPress shortcode parser does not handle the mixing of enclosing and non-enclosing forms of the same shortcode and you will not get the results you want.
